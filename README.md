# McPassword Hasher extension for firefox

This is an updated version of the classic wjjo password hasher updated to work with web extensions and also with a workaround for many sites that use frameworks that prevented the old extension from finding password blanks.

## Installation

## How to use
1. Open the hasher
   1. by pressing Ctrl+F6 (linux, mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F6 (windows and all else)
   1. or by clicking the icon in your toolbar.
1. Enter a master password
1. Adjust the site tag if necessary
1. Click options and adjust your preferences for this site
1. Confirm by
   1. clicking Fill in Blank, then clicking the red bordered blanks in your page
   1. or by clicking the site password blank and copying the password to your clipboard
1. Your settings will be saved for this site moment you do either of the above actions.

## Extension configuration
Go to the addons page (about:addons) and adjust settings as necessary.  These settings will be used in the absence of more specific settings for a particular site that you've created a password for before.
